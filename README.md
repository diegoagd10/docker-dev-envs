# Docker images for development environments

These images were created to avoid installing the development dependencies for running applications. In this way, we don't have to pass again for the installation process.

All the images were created based on [Alpine Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) to save space on the disc.

## Available images

* [Scala](scala)
